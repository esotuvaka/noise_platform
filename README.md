# NOISE PLATFORM

## A soundboard written in Rust + TypeScript

Rather than purchasing a soundboard, this was created as a fun project to learn rust on the desktop. Its basic and not very idiomatic, but has been a blast to make and use to mess around with friends.

Feel free to contribute!

## Complete

- Button to open "Noises" folder
- Button to list available "noise" files
- Get file duration
- Map keybinds (and save them so they persist between app open/close)
- Button to preview listening to the sound

## Ongoing

- Make existing keybinds visible in the frontend on initial app open
- Keyboard listener thats active while the app is open, that plays sound when keybind pressed
- Check sounds folder after the prompt window closes to refresh all mp3s in the app
- Play the sound through the mic at same time as it plays in headphones
- Volume settings

## Observations:

- Can either get the keybinds data in Rust or React
